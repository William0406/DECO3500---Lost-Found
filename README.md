Overview TripRace is a social, mobile mini-game designed to make group travel decision-making faster, more enjoyable, and conflict-free. When friends travel together, they often have different opinions about destinations or activities. This can lead to arguments, wasted time, and a negative travel experience. TripRace transforms this common frustration into a fun, collaborative racing game where decisions are made through play rather than debate. Our design combines social interaction, real-time collaboration, and lighthearted competition to turn group disagreement into joyful consensus.

Project Concept Problem Space During group trips, travelers frequently encounter disagreements about what to do next—whether to visit which spot, eat at a restaurant, or rest. Traditional discussion or voting takes time and sometimes generates tension.

Design Goal To accelerate group decisions while keeping everyone engaged and happy through a shared game experience.

Core Idea TripRace turns group decision-making into a racing game. Players race simultaneously while collecting ⭐ stars — each star represents a suggested travel plan from earlier group discussion. At the end of the race, the most collected stars indicate the group’s collective preference.

How It Works Pre-Game Chat All players join a shared chatroom. They discuss ideas (e.g., “go hiking”, “visit museum”, “try local food”). Each idea becomes a ⭐ Star Plan, numbered from 1 to 5.

Race Phase Everyone enters a classic 2D obstacle-avoidance racing game. Players drive while collecting ⭐ stars linked to the ideas they prefer. Colliding with obstacles pauses the car for 1 second. The race lasts 1–2 minutes.

Decision Phase Each player’s collected ⭐ stars are tallied. The group’s most-collected idea becomes the final travel decision. To reward skill, the first-place racer’s vote carries higher weight, but the result still reflects the group’s majority preference. This system ensures fairness, speeds up decisions, and maintains a fun group atmosphere.
